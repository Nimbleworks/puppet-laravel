Puppet Module Laravel
=====================
by Nino Paolo Amarillento

Puppet Module for the latest version of Laravel - PHP Framework.

As of Feb 15, 2013 - this will download <strong>Laravel 4</strong>


Installation
------------

I assumed that you have Vagrant environment already, or if you don't have one yet, you can download and run [vagrant-lamp](https://github.com/paolooo/vagrant-lamp).
    
    
<b>On git root or toplevel directory</b> run the following.   

`git submodule add https://github.com/paolooo/puppet-laravel.git puppet/modules`
`git submodule update`
